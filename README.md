### 👨🏼‍💻 About Me
I’m a data scientist with 7+ years in quality engineering, building machine learning projects in forecasting, churn, and optimization. I focus on bridging technical rigor with business outcomes, sharing applied projects that showcase predictive modeling, bootstrapping, and analytics.

I thoroughly enjoy playing guitar and writing music with my band, Perenna, in my downtime!
